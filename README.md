# Paul Friedrich - Data Science and AI

## About
This is my repository of projects which I have completed or which I am planning on completing. This is a to do list for myself as well as a portfolio for (job) applications. 
I am starting my Github profile a few months after I have started my Masters in Data Science. I have completed or started various smaller projects over the last years which I will upload piece by piece over the next days. You will therefore see a peak in my contributions.
