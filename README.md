# Paul Friedrich - Data Science and AI

## About
This is my repository of projects which I have completed or which I am planning on completing. This is a to do list for myself as well as a portfolio for (job) applications. 
I am starting my Github profile a few months after I have started my Masters in Data Science. I have completed or started a number of smaller projects over the last years which I will upload piece by piece.

## Uploads
### [House Price Regression](https://github.com/Paul1911/Data-Science-and-AI/blob/main/Projects%20%26%20Exercises/House%20Price%20Regression%20-%20setup%2C%20data%20preparation%2C%20first%20modelling%20with%20XGBRegressor%20.ipynb)

This is my first submission of the [House Price Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) on Kaggle. Currently place 3075 of 6780. Next steps are feature engineering and research how to improve my RMSE score. This project has highest priority currently. 

### [Web Scraping, API's, Pandas](https://github.com/Paul1911/Data-Science-and-AI/blob/main/Projects%20%26%20Exercises/Web%20Scraping%2C%20API's%2C%20Pandas.ipynb)

This is a workbook a friend of mine was confronted with and asked me for tutoring. Usually I do not post exercises here. However as I was helping my friend without having access to his lecture resources, this seemed challenging and triggered my interest to puzzle over certain points. 

### Network Planning DHL Europe 

This is a challenge from my Bachelors of International Aviation Managment
