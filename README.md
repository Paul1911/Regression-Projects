# Paul Friedrich - Data Science and AI

## About
This is my repository of projects which I have completed or which I am planning on completing. This is a to do list for myself as well as a portfolio for (job) applications. 
I am starting my Github profile a few months after I have started my Masters in Data Science. I have completed or started a number of smaller projects over the last years which I will upload piece by piece.

## Uploads
### [House Price Regression](https://github.com/Paul1911/Data-Science-and-AI/blob/main/Projects%20%26%20Exercises/House%20Price%20Regression%20-%20setup%2C%20data%20preparation%2C%20first%20modelling%20with%20XGBRegressor%20.ipynb)

This is my first submission of the [House Price Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) on Kaggle. Currently place 3075 of 6780. Next steps are feature engineering and research how to improve my RMSE score. This project has highest priority currently. 

### [Web Scraping, API's, Pandas](https://github.com/Paul1911/Data-Science-and-AI/blob/main/Projects%20%26%20Exercises/Web%20Scraping%2C%20API's%2C%20Pandas.ipynb)

This is a workbook a friend of mine was confronted with and asked me for tutoring. Usually I do not post exercises here. However as I was helping my friend without having access to his lecture resources, this seemed challenging in parts and triggered my interest to puzzle over certain points. I completed this in October 2020. 

### Network Planning DHL Europe 

This is a challenge from my Bachelors of International Aviation Management from 2017. The goal was to develop a flight plan for DHL out of their (at the time) new hub Leipzig. This comprised planning for the transport of packages on 173x172 OnDs via train and Road Feeder Services while adhering to time constraints for pickup, delivery, slots @LEJ, etc. By that time, we completed the project without numerical optimization methods (as expected by the university). However, I quickly realized that this is nothing but an optimization problem with many constraints, minimizing cost. Therefore it must be able to solve it systematically. 
This is the long term aim of this project. In this context, I wrote a small program in 2018 using a Google API to measure the street distances for all ca. 30000 OnDs. Please also find the exact project description and setup ideas here.
